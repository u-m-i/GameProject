# GameProject

University's game project that goes with the Introduction to programming 1

## Innovations

Vectorial math, the using of this data struct was very insighful for me, also the math involved taught me to deal with vectors, allowing me to simulate simple physics with experimentation.

Using maps to simplify the process of coding the directions
Adding the p5 library at custom time
Using generators to simulate gravity and the continous agregation of force
Using modules to divide the code
Add compression to the files

### Todo

- Increase jump distance (done)
- Code collision with platforms
  - Collision underneath (done)
  - Use the limits with the gravity (done)
- Code collission with coins
- Code pitfalls

- Create a creator function to instatiate multiple props depending in a number given

## Results
